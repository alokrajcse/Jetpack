#Android Activity Life Cycle
The Android Activity Lifecycle is a series of states an activity goes through from creation to destruction. Understanding these states is crucial for managing application behavior and resource management. Here's a brief overview:

onCreate(): Called when the activity is first created. This is where you initialize your activity, including UI components and data.

onStart(): Called when the activity becomes visible to the user. Any functionality that needs to be started as the activity enters the foreground can be placed here.

onResume(): Called when the activity starts interacting with the user. This is a good place to start animations, audio, or any other processes that need to run while the activity is in the foreground.

onPause(): Called when the system is about to start another activity. Use this method to pause ongoing actions that should not continue (such as a video) and to save any persistent data.

onStop(): Called when the activity is no longer visible to the user. This is where you should release resources that are not needed while the activity is not visible, such as network connections.

onRestart(): Called when the activity is coming back to the foreground after being stopped. This is often used to reinitialize components that were released during onStop().

onDestroy(): Called before the activity is destroyed. This is the final call the activity receives. It's used for cleanup, releasing resources, and ensuring that any remaining tasks are completed.

Each method in the lifecycle has a specific role, and handling them appropriately ensures a smooth user experience and efficient resource management.
